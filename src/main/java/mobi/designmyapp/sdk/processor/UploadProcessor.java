/**
 * Created by Lo√Øc Ortola on 23/7/14.
 * An upload processor is a descriptor used to upload and process template specific files
 * When uploading a file, a namespace has to be provided.
 * The namespace will determine which upload processor will be used
 * The processor will be able to specify:
 * -which extensions are valid or not
 * -a specific synchronized processing to apply before response is sent
