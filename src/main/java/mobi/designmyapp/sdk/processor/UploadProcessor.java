 * Created by Lo√Øc Ortola on 23/07/14.
 * UploadProcessor is a descriptor class used to upload and process template specific files.
 * Provide your own implementation(s) if resource upload features are needed through the API.
 * Implementing UploadProcessor sub classes is not mandatory.
 * An UploadProcessor specifies:
 * - which extensions are valid or not
 * - which specific processing to apply before response is sent. Warning: the processing is synchronous.
 * The UploadProcessor can be Typed with a POJO used as payload in the Http Response.
